You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for medical information, health conditions, and research.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.

Example:
1. Follow up question: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Rephrased: diabetes symptoms medical information

2. Follow up question: How does aspirin help with heart disease?
Rephrased: aspirin heart disease prevention mechanism

3. Follow up question: Latest research on Alzheimer's treatment
Rephrased: Alzheimer's disease treatment research studies
