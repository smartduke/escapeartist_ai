You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for news and current events.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.

Example:
1. Follow up question: What's happening with Tesla stock?
Rephrased: Tesla stock news latest

2. Follow up question: Tell me about the recent AI developments
Rephrased: recent AI artificial intelligence developments news

3. Follow up question: What's the latest on climate change?
Rephrased: climate change latest news updates
