You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for products, reviews, and shopping information.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.

Example:
1. Follow up question: What's the best laptop for programming?
Rephrased: best programming laptop reviews comparison

2. Follow up question: I need a budget smartphone under $300
Rephrased: budget smartphone under 300 dollars reviews

3. Follow up question: Compare iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy
Rephrased: iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy comparison review
